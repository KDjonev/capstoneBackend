API for storing and retrieving heatmap data for SmartNetwork mobile app. Heatmaps contain heatmap points which are points on the heatmap where a speed test was taken. Each point can store many different metrics to help find overall connectivity. each heatmap can have multiple routers and only one residence. Each router has router specific details and can have mutiple heatmaps associated with it but only one residence. A residence has information associated with the household and can have many routers and heatmaps associated with it.

The endpoints include:
 - Storing a heatmap, heatmap points, router, and residence information.
 - Searching for residences, based off address or account number.
 - Searching for heatmaps and their associated points based off an ID.
